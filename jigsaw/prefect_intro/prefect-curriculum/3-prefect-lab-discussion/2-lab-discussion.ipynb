    "The most important component to how we set up our prefect code was to isolate our codebase from prefect.  Prefect is a complicated tool -- all workflow managers are, and we can simplify our code by isolating our codebase from prefect. This means that each task only calls a single prefect function.\n",

    "\n",
    "It's a tricky thing to decide how to divide up our tasks.  Essentially, we want each of our tasks to provide user value.  \n",

    "\n",
    "* Why not just have one giant task?\n",
    "\n",
    "Why don't we just put all of our code inside of a single task?  Won't that make things easier?  Well remember that we're going to schedule runs of this workflow, so when something goes wrong we want to be able to debug it.  By splitting our workflow into discrete tasks, prefect will tell us which one of these tasks broke, and we can better debug just that simpler task.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll also see that prefect can retry tasks that fail.  Let's say that the write_to_csv task fails.  If we have a retry, prefect will not retry the entire workflow, but just what failed.  This will save time and resources (if say we have to pay for API use)."
